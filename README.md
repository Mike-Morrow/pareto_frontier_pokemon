# Pokemon

The Pareto Frontier helps us determine which Pokemon belong in a good lineup. If one Pokemon is worse across all categories than another Pokemon, the inferior Pokemon will not be on the frontier. We compare every Pokemon with every other Pokemon to determine whether it belongs on the frontier.

A radar chart is a good visual for the Pareto Frontier. If you overlay the radars for 2 Pokemon, and one radar chart is entirely subsumed by the other, that means it's worse across the board in stats and does not belong on the frontier.
